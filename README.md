# 3D Printed Quadcopter using Arduino Nano BLE Sense
This is a personal project to discover how to make a DIY project from the ground up using 3D printing. I will be challenging myself with building a DIY FPV quadcopter using my Ender 3 and some drone parts and little to no specialized equipment for most of the drone's parts.

I plan on using Reinforcement Learning to stabilize the drone as a first action when the components are assembled.
Because of the computational and memory constraints on the target board, we will need to convert the model using TensorFlow Lite for optimization.
